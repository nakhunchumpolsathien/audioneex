Audioneex is an audio content recognition engine specifically designed
for real-time applications. It is general purpose, based on content-agnostic
algorithms and runs on all kinds of machines, from big servers to mobile and 
embedded devices.

Features

- **Compact fingerprints** - 1 hr of audio encoded in less than a MB
- **Fast identification** - only a few seconds to perform a recognition
- **Content-agnostic** - recognition of audio of different nature
- **Cross-platform** - runs anywhere there is a modern C++ compiler (v11+)
- **IoT & Mobile-ready** - runs well on small devices for on-device ACR
- **Database-neutral** - can be used with any database (requires drivers)


## Documentation

The official documentation can be found [here](https://audioneex.readthedocs.io)


## Quick start

The engine needs the following dependencies

- Boost
- FFTSS
- Tokyo Cabinet | Couchbase
- TagLib  (optional)
- FFmpeg  (optional)

After compiling and installing the dependencies, open a shell and issue the 
following commands to start the build process

    $ git clone https://github.com/nakhunchumpolsathien/audioneex
    $ cd audioneex
    $ ./build WITH_EXAMPLES=ON

This will build the library along with the demo programs within the `_build` directory. 
Please refer to the [documentation](https://audioneex.readthedocs.io) for more 
details.


## Demo app

If you want to see the engine in action and play around with it straight away
there is a demo app for Windows that can be downloaded from [here](https://www.audioneex.com/downloads/)
